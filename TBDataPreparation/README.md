### 202108_SPS: Testbeam at CERN SPS H8 line. 
The following are instructions to handle raw test-beam data taken at the CERN SPS 2021 test beam. The entire production takes about 4 hours.
1. Git clone the test-beam sw on lxplus
   ```sh
   git@github.com:lopezzot/DREMTubes.git
   ```
2. Copy the entire directory with raw data for auxiliary detectors (preshower, muon counter, cherenkov counters, ...) and PMT-read-out towers. Create the rawNtuple folder for data rootification
   ```sh
   cp -r /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_H8/rawData/ .
   mkdir rawNtuple/
   ```
   One file is saved per each run and named sps2021.data.runNo.txt.bz2, with run numbers from 400 to 743. Therefore the entire data collection goes from ```sps2021.data.run400.txt.bz2``` to ```sps2021.data.run743.txt.bz2```.
3. Transform ASCII files to root files. Edit ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/DRrootify.py``` so that ```datapath``` and ```ntuplepath``` variables point to the ```rawData/``` and the ```rawNtuples/``` folders respectively. Then rootify the data
   ```sh
   python DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/DRrootify.py
   ```
   Hint: if something goes wrong just re-run the command, it will check for already produced .root files and skip them.
4. Copy the raw data from SiPM DAQ, and create directory for merged files
   ```sh
   cp -r /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_H8/rawNtupleSiPM/ .
   mkdir mergedNtuple
   ```
4. Merge the information from the two DAQs. Edit the ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/DR_BlendedDaq2Root.py``` and make sure that the ```SiPMFileDir```, ```DaqFileDir``` and ```MergedFileDir``` point to the correct directories. Then
   ```sh
   python DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/DR_BlendedDaq2Root.py --newFiles
   ```
5. Create folder for reconstrcuted files. Edit ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/DoPhysicsConverter.py``` so that ```mrgpath```, ```recpath``` and ```phspath``` point to the correct repositories. Also edit ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/PhysicsConverter.C``` and modify the ```infile``` variable so that it points to the merged files directory. Then, apply calibration constants and high-level objects abstaction
   ```sh
   cd DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/
   python DoPhysicsConverter.py
   ```
### 202108_SPS UPDATE (June 2022): data production with modified calibration constants for PMTs and PheToGeV for SiPMs
The following are instructions to produce set of reconstructed ntuples for physics analyisis with updated calibration.
1. It starts from ```/eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_H8/CERNDATA/v1.3/mergedNtuple/```.
   Run the macro ```DoCalibrationSPS.C```
   ```sh
   cd DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/PMT/
   root -l 'DoCalibrationSPS.C'
   ```
   It produces the file ```pmt_json.txt``` that has pedestal values, values for PMT calibrations and p.e. to GeV conversion values for SiPMs.
   These values are inserted in
   ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/RunXXX_modified_v1.3.5.json```
2. Modification in existing codes:
   In ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/PhysicsConverter.C``` calibration objects are initialized with ```RunXXX_modified_v1.3.5.json```
3. To produce the new reconstructed ntuples first edit the variables ```recpath``` and ```phspath``` in ```DoPhysicsConverter.py```. Then run it.
   ```sh
   cd DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/
   python DoPhysicsConverter.py
   ```
4. Using these steps the reconstructed ntuples are produced in
   ```sh
   /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_H8/CERNDATA/v1.3.5/
   ```

   These values are inserted in
   ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/RunXXX_modified.json```
2. Modification in existing codes:
   The method ```calibratePMT``` has modified with new equations in ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/PhysicsEvent.h```.
   In ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/PhysicsConverter.C``` calibration objects are initialized with ```RunXXX_modified.json```
3. To produce the new reconstructed ntuples first edit the variables ```recpath``` and ```phspath``` in ```DoPhysicsConverter.py```. Then run it.
   ```sh
   cd DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/
   python DoPhysicsConverter.py
   ```
4. Using these steps the reconstructed ntuples are produced in
   ```sh
   /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_H8/CERNDATA/v1.3.4/
   ```  
   
### 202106_DESY: Testbeam at DESY. 

The following are instructions to handle raw test-beam data taken at the DESY 2021 test beam. The entire production takes about 4 hours.
1. Git clone the test-beam sw on lxplus
   ```sh
   git@github.com:lopezzot/DREMTubes.git
   ```
2. Raw data for PMT-read-out towers are in the /eos space. Create the rawNtuple folder for data rootification
   ```sh
   ls /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_Desy/rawData/
   mkdir rawNtuple/
   ```
   One file is saved per each run and named desydata.runNo.txt.bz2, with run numbers from 400 to 743. Therefore the entire data collection goes from ```sps2021.data.run19.txt.bz2``` to ```sps2021.data.run396.txt.bz2```.
3. Transform ASCII files to root files. Edit ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_DESY/scripts/DRrootify.py``` so that ```datapath``` and ```ntuplepath``` variables point to the ```rawData/``` and the ```rawNtuples/``` folders respectively. Then rootify the data
   ```sh
   python DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_DESY/scripts/DRrootify.py
   ```
   Hint: if something goes wrong just re-run the command, it will check for already produced .root files and skip them.
4. Raw data from SiPM DAQ are copied in the /eos space; create rawNtuple folder for data rootification
   ```sh
   ls /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_Desy/rawDataSiPM/
   mkdir rawNtupleSiPM
   ```
5. Transform data files to root files. Edit ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_DESY/SIPM/convert.py``` so that ```datapath``` and ```ntuplepath``` variables point to the ```rawData/``` and the ```rawNtuples/``` folders respectively. Then rootify the data
   ```sh
   python DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_DESY/SIPM/convert.py
   ```
6. Merge the information from the two DAQs. Edit the ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/DR_BlendedDaq2Root.py``` and make sure that the ```SiPMFileDir```, ```DaqFileDir``` and ```MergedFileDir``` point to the correct directories. Then
   ```sh
   mkdir /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_Desy/mergedNtuple/
   python DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_DESY/scripts/DR_BlendedDaq2Root.py --newFiles
   ```
7. Perform calibration on the PMTs   
   * Edit the macro ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_DESY/PMT/DoCalibration.cxx``` and make sure the paths are correct. 
   * There are three distinct calibrations for the PMTs, depending on the HW configuration (see here https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/DREAM/GoodRunList the good run list for details
      * myconf= 0 : // yellow filter
      * myconf= 1 : // no yellow filter
      * myconf= 2 : // no yellow filter and PMT_C ampliefied 
   * Run the macro in root
    ```sh
     root
     .x DoCalibration.cxx(myconf)
     ```
   * it produce three output files in /eos/user/i/ideadr/TB2021_Desy/PMT_calibration/
      * equal_myconf.txt
      * pedestal_myconf.txt
      * pmt_json_myconf.txt
      where myconf is 0,1 or 2
   * copy the pmt_json_myconf.txt last part to the json file in the ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_DESY/scripts/Run_myconf.json``` directory. Also here you will need three files. Both the PMT and the PhetoGeVS (C) parts need to be updated   
8. Create folder for reconstrcuted files. Edit ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/DoPhysicsConverter.py``` so that ```mrgpath``` and ```recpath``` point to the correct repositories. Also edit ```DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202108_SPS/scripts/PhysicsConverter.C``` and modify the ```infile``` and ```outfile``` variables so that ther points to the correct directories. Then, apply calibration constants and high-level objects abstaction
   ```sh
   cd DREMTubes/TBDataPreparation/202106_Desy/scripts/
   python DoPhysicsConverter.py myconf
   ```
